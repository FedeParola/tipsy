#+TITLE: TIPSY: Telco pIPeline benchmarking SYstem
#+AUTHOR: Tamás Lévai, Felicián Németh, Gábor Rétvári (BME)

TIPSY is a benchmark suite to evaluate and compare the performance of
different programmable data plane technologies and network-function
virtualization frameworks over a set of standard scenarios rooted in
telecommunications practice. Currently there is a BNG (Broadband Network
Gateway) and a 5G MGW (Mobile Gateway) defined and implemented in TIPSY.

The aim of TIPSY is to provide the networking community with a set of
*standardized telco-oriented scenarios* on top of which different
*programmable data plane technologies can be fairly and comprehensibly be
evaluated*.  The target audience is network operators who want to test new
data-plane equipment, network engineers evaluating the scaling properties
of some programmable switch in terms of a well-defined parameter of a
well-defined pipeline, or researchers willing to compare a new data plane
algorithm or data structure with existing and established technology.

TIPSY comprises five elemental parts, each at varying level of maturity:

- a set of telco pipelines with working implementations (currently OpenFlow
  and BESS are supported, contributions are welcome),
- a test suite to validate the implementations (ongoing),
- a configuration system that allows to fine-tune general parameters of the
  pipelines (supported),
- a tunable trace generator to generate deterministic traffic traces to
  support repeatable experiments and reproducible results (supported),
- a distributed measurement infrastructure to feed the traffic traces to the
  system-under-test and an evaluation framework that visualizes the results
  (rudimentary).

** What TIPSY is

- A collection of pipelines that model real telco use cases: the intention
  for TIPSY is to serve as an elemental data-plane benchmarking suite for
  practitioners and researchers.
- A measurement support framework: TIPSY will automatically generate
  detailed configs, working pipelines, and complete traffic traces to start
  testing right away.
- A tool to perform repeatable experiments: TIPSY devotes huge emphasis to
  support reproducibility, like it automatically generates deterministic
  traffic traces, and supports multiple traffic-dropping policies to never
  lose packets, etc.

** What TIPSY is not

- A fully fledged measurement system: TIPSY will not setup the measurement
  configuration automatically and there are certain steps that need to be
  done manually by the user, like connecting the SUT and the tester; the
  intention is to minimize manual intervention as much as possible.
- A comprehensive collection of telco pipelines (contributions are welcome)
  or a canonical implementations of the ones supported (of course, there is
  more that one way to do it).
- An Internet scale performance measurement framework: TIPSY is best suited
  to evaluate a single device under test connected back-to-back with a
  traffic generator.

** If you find TIPSY to not work for you

You can find a comprehensive list of alternative data plane benchmark
suites and a lot of background on data plane testing in the below paper.

* Architecture

The general TIPSY setup will contain a System Under Test (SUT) that runs
the data plane to be evaluated, a Tester that feeds the SUT with a traffic
trace and measures performance, and a Controller that can exercise the
performance of the SUT under updates.  Drawing from telco practice, TIPSY
distinguishes between the *uplink* direction (user-to-network direction)
and the *downlink* direction (user-to-network direction); the downlink port
is the attachment port for the access network (users) and the uplink port
connects to the public Internet. In pratice, however, the uplink and
downlink ports of the SUT are connected back-to-back to the same Tester
device for supporting versatile evaluation setups.

Input to TIPSY is a high-level description of the intended measurement,
like the name of the pipeline to be coded into the SUT and the general
parameters (number of users, number of Internet routes, etc.) and the
output is a set of configurations/data-plane programs that can be loaded
into the SUT, plus a set of traffic traces for each config, that can be
used to do the evaluation. Currently these must be loaded manually into the
SUT and the Tester; fully automated benchmarks are works in progress at the
moment.

Apart from the static configuration for the pipelines, aimed for evaluating
the SUT in steady state, TIPSY also contains an additional set of "update"
scenarios that can be used to benchmark the SUT under updates initiated by
the control plane. The implementations that come with TIPSY pipelines
contain code to feed the updates, via the Controller module, with
configurable intensity into the SUT.

* Pipelines

The below table provides an overview of the TIPSY pipelines along with the
features each one uses and the current availability of an implementation in
the TIPSY code.

** Mobile Gateway (MGW)

The mobile gateway pipeline (=mgw=) represents a simplified 5G gateway that
connects a set of mobile user equipments (UEs), located behind different
base stations (BSTs), to a set of public servers available on the Internet.

[[./doc/fig/mgw.png]]

*** Static pipeline

In the uplink direction (UE/BST -> server) the MGW receives
GTP-encapsulated packets from the base stations, where the source IP
identifies the BST, the source IP address in the encapsulated IP packet
identifies the user, and the GTP TEID identifies the bearer.  It performs
various checks, decapsulates the UE's packet from the GTP tunnel,
identifies the user and polices the UE (rate limiting), and then routes the
decapculated packer to the Internet.

In the downlink direction (server -> user/bst) the MGW receives normal
packets from the Internet and the pipeline is basically the reverse of the
uplink one: identify the UE/bearer based on the packet destination IP
address (we now assume there is only one bearer per user), rate limit the
UE flow, and encapsulate and send the packet to the BST behind which the UE
is currently located.

In particular, the MGW performs the following processing steps per
uplink/downlink packet:

Uplink:

- L2, L3 and L4 check (gateway MAC/IP and UDP port destination 2152)
- GTP decap, save TEID
- rate limit per bearer (TEID)
- L3 routing towards the Internet + L2 fwd

Downlink:
- L2 and L3 check (check if destination IP is in the UE range)
- per user rate limiting
- GTP encap (set bearer in TEID)
- set destination IP of the base station of the UE
- L3 routing towards BSTs + L2 fwd

This roughly maps to the below modules:
- Ingress:
  - =l2_fwd=: identify local packets
  - =ether_type=: identify ARP/IP packets
  - =dir_selector=: distinguish uplink/downlink packets
- Egress:
  - =rate_limiter=: per user traffic policing
  - =ip_lookup=: route to servers (uplink) and BSTs (downlink)
  - =group table=: next-hop setting per server and BST
- Uplink: Ingress -> GTP decap -> Egress
- Downlink: Ingress -> GTP encap -> Egress

*** Dynamic scenarios

TIPSY defined the below update scenarios for the MGW pipeline.

- Arrival/departure of a user: when a new UE arrives/departs to/from a BST,
  the pipeline needs to be updated as follows: TODO
- User mobility (handover): TODO
- Addition/removal of a server: TODO
