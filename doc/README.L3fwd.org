#+TITLE: L2 Port Forwarding (PORTfwd)
#+AUTHOR: Tamás Lévai, Felicián Németh, Gábor Rétvári (BME)

The L3 Packet Forwarding pipeline (name: =l3fwd=) models a basic L3 router,
with MAC destination checking, =ether_type= lookup, L3 routing and next-hop
processing.  The aim is to benchmark the raw L3 routing capabilities of a
data-plane technology. 

Note that the implemented L3 functionality is limited and the pipeline
cannot be used in the place of a fully fledged IP router: L3fwd does not do
MAC learning, does not include an ARP responder, does not do full RFC 1812
IP header checking, it does not implement IPv6 right, etc. Moreover, the
pipeline does not support VRFs; VLANs are for TODO at the moment.

* Static pipeline

The upstream direction the pipeline will receive L3 packets encapsulated
into a L2 header from the downlink port of the SUT, perform L3 lookup, and
do group processing before forwarding to the uplink port. The downstream
pipeline is effectively the same, but the IP lookup tables and group tables
are separate between the upstream and downstream pipelines.

The steps performed during upstream/downstream processing are as follows:

- =MACfwd=: a basic MAC table lookup to check that the L2 header of the
  receiver packet contains the router's own MAC address(es) in which case
  forward to the =ARPselect= module, drop otherwise (subject to the
  =fakedrop= policy)
- =ARPselect=: directs ARP packets to the infra (currently unimplemented)
  and IPv4 to the =L3FIB= for L3 processing, otherwise drop (subject to the
  =fakedrop= policy)
- =L3FIB=: perform longest-prefix-matching from an IP lookup table and
  forward packets to the appropriate group table entry for next-hop
  processing or drop if no matching L3 entry is found
- =Group=: Group Table for next-hop processing, which contains the
  following steps: rewrite source MAC address to the egress port MAC
  address, rewrite destination MAC address to the (statically generated)
  next-hop MAC address, decrease TTL, recompute the IPv4 header checksum,
  and send to the outgoing port

Note that the traffic trace generated for the L3fwd pipeline will exercise
the L3 pipeline via the =MACfwd=-=ARPselect=-=L3FIB=-=Group= path, i.e.,
the traces will not contain ARP packets, packets with foreign MAC
destination addresses, or L3 headers other than IPv4. Further note that ARP
entries are statically set at the time of pipeline setup (but may
dynamically change in a =table=update= event, see below).

* Dynamic scenarios

The L3fwd pipeline defines the following dynamic scenarios.

- =l3-table-update=: an entry is added to/removed from the =L3FIB=
- =group-update=: an entry is added to/removed from the =Group= table

* Pipeline configuration

A sample TIPSY configuration for the PORTfwd pipeline is shown below:

#+BEGIN_SRC javascript
{
    "pipeline": {
         "name": "L3fwd",
         "upstream-l3-table-size": 100000,
         "upstream-group-table-size": 14,
         "downstream-l3-table-size": 20, 
         "downstream-group-table-size": 1,
         "fluct-l3-table": 3,
         "fluct-group-table": 0,
         "fakedrop": false
    }
}
#+END_SRC

The parameters specific to the MGW pipeline are as follows:

- =name=: name of the pipeline, must be set to =l3fwd= for the L3fwd
  pipeline
- =upstream-l3-table-size=: number of destination entries (prefixes) in the
  =L3FIB= lookup table, upstream direction
- =upstream-group-table-size=: number of group table entries (next-hops),
  upstream direction
- =downstream-l3-table-size=: number of destination entries (prefixes) in
  the =L3FIB= lookup table, downstream direction
- =downstream-group-table-size=: number of group table entries (next-hops),
  downstream direction
- =fluct-l3-table=: number of =l3-table-update= events to the =L3FIB=
  module per sec
- =fluct-group-table=: number of =l3-group-update= events to the =Group=
  Table per sec
- =fakedrop=: whether to actually drop unmatched packets (=false=) or send
  them immediately to the output port (=false=) for correct rate
  measurements
